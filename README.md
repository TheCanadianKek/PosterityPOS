# Posterity POS

## NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION USE
##### Currently in development stages

## Project Aim:
To create an open-source, basic POS system for personal skill development.

In its current stages, this is meant to be something to improve my personal skills. While it could be used as a actual POS system in the future, the lack of security as well as the lack of support means that it would be a very poor idea to use.
